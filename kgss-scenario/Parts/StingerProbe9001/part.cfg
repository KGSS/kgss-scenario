description = After consulting the always trustful Al Kerman from down the road, the space program got given this potpourri of wonderful second-hand car parts all stuck together (and the duct tape was free-of-charge!) Then the guys over at R&D stuffed in all their sciency stuff and wrapped it up nicely in some metal that wasn't being used at the time, and bam, we now have an impactor probe! Warranty void if probe comes into contact with ground, but based on data gathered from the launch vehicle, the chance of such an occurrence is very low.
